# Face Tracking Web App

This is a real-time **face tracking** web application built with **Flask** and **OpenCV**.  
It uses your webcam to detect faces, draws green bounding boxes around them, and shows a label explaining what's being tracked — all without storing any personal data.

> ✅ No data storage  
> ✅ Just clean, ethical face detection
